Hello ðŸ‘‹,

I'm Jonathan, a passionate Biology Method Developer specializing in the fascinating fields of marine bioprospecting and infectomics. With a deep-rooted interest in uncovering the biological treasures of our oceans and understanding the complex world of infectious diseases, I dedicate my work to developing innovative methodologies that bridge the gap between marine biology and disease research.

ðŸŒŠ In the realm of marine bioprospecting, I focus on sustainable and ethical approaches to discover novel compounds from marine organisms. These efforts are aimed at harnessing their potential for pharmaceutical applications, biotechnology, and conservation.

ðŸ¦  As for infectomics, I delve into the integration of omics technologies to better understand pathogen-host interactions and the dynamics of infectious diseases. My goal is to contribute to the development of targeted treatments and preventive strategies through detailed molecular insights.

On my GitHub, you'll find a variety of projects ranging from data-driven models and bioinformatics tools to experimental protocols that I've developed or am actively working on. I am always eager to collaborate and exchange ideas with fellow researchers and developers in the bio-tech community.

Let's connect and make a significant impact together!
